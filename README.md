## Overview
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. This project demonstrates how to calculate the cosine similarity between two images by converting them into grayscale, flattening the image arrays, and using the `cosine_similarity` function from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- opencv-python
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn
